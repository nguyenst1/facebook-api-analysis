Therefore, each of us would do visualization for each two questions. The technology that we will use for our visualization and analysis is Tableau. We will import the csv files that we created in the second notebook into Tableau. Furthermore, we decide that we would also use SQL to manipulate the dataframe since our tables are not yet tidied. We use SQL Workbench to pivot our liked photos and liked posts tables."

    "The map visualization represents the places that we have been tagged when using Facebook. It shows world map and the red dots representing the place that we have travelled, based on the latitudes and longitudes. As we can see, around the Eastern Region of the United States is the place that we are mostly tagged. This is correct, since we both are college students and both go to Denison University, which is in the East of the United States. As a result, majority of places that we have been tagged are around Ohio area, whose latitude and longitude are 39.99 and -82.9. For some special ocassions, such as during breaks, we travel around the region that closed to our campus, therefore, there are also some red dots in Virginia, Delaware, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. The fact that the red dots are only around Ohio area because when traveling, we decide to choose some places that closed to our school so that will save much money and time since break is short. The only place from the West that we have been tagged on Facebook is California. This could be during Winter Break, which is a month-long break, we have more time to travel. Furthermore, as computer science majors, we would also like to travel to California despite the distance since we want to visit the large tech company such as Facebook, Google,... As we can see, this does make sense since California, whose latitude and longitude are 32.85 and -117.3, is the only place that far from Ohio that we would travel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another places that we also have been tagged on Facebook are United Kingdom, whose latitude and longitude are 51.84 and -2.2 and India, whose latitude and longitude are 22.54 and 88.4. This makes sense. We went to United Kingdom to study abroad for a Spring Semester, therefore, we have been tagged in the United Kingdom on Facebook. Furthermore, there are also some red dots in India area. This is because we from India and we visit India during summer. As a result, it is recorded on Facebook and represented by some red dots. Overall, the graph API is really accurate. It records every places that we have been travelling. As we can see, this Facebook Graph API is really useful for someone who wants to find a specific location of a person."

This graph shows that after Farhan, Varun Shar is the one who likes our photos the most, which is 20 likes. The average likes from other friends is around 9 likes for our photos. This plot makes sense, since we the top 20 friends who like post are the ones that are very closed to us. To be specific, Varun Shar is our best friend, therefore, she follows our page and gives many likes for all of our photos. The others are also closed to us, but not as closed as Varun Shar. Therefore, their average number of likes is only around 9. The friend that gives us lowest likes is Gargi Malhora, who likes our photos 5 times. Needless to say, Gargi is least closed to us compare to the other friends.\n",

    "Furthermore, our Facebook pages are not really active, since we do not always post stuff on them. Therefore, 20 photos are a lot. Varun Shar gives us 20 likes, in other word, she likes 20 photos of ours. Therefore, we can say that since she is our closest friend, she gives us the most likes. The more closed they are, the more likes they give us and vice versa. However, we can dictate the fact whether our friends are closed to us just based on the number of likes they give. There are some special ocassions that our friends are closed but they do not use Facebook often. Therefore, they do not follow us that often so that they could give us likes. Drawing analysis on how closed our friends are based on number of likes that they give is not really accurate. Therefore, we will not assume \"the friendship\" on number of likes on Facebook. However, we will also want to see if this is really correct since our modern society is influenced largely by technology and social medial. As we result, we will draw an analysis on number of likes on EVERY posts that we have posted on Facebook, not just photos. Posts can be status, shares, events, or videos."

The friends who remain in the list are Keshav Khemka, Mallika Kapur, Varun Shar, and Nikhil Shrestha.

But we can assume that Keshav Khemka, Mallika Kapur, Varun Shar, and Nikhil Shrestha give the most like to our posts since they are the closest to us.

The question is not how number of likes dictacte how closed our friends are, but it is whether we can decide the relationship between our best friends and number of likes. Indeed, there is a relationship between these two. In real life, Keshav Khemka, Mallika Kapur, Varun Shar, and Nikhil Shrestha are surely our best friends. As a result, when we draw an analysis on them, we can see that due to being our best friends, the number of likes that they give for our posts are the highest."

While Hillary's posts seem to render many reactions of 'SADNESS'.

The topics that we are interested in analyzing in our project are the top 20 friends who like our photos, our posts, demographic analysis on places that we have been tagged on Facebook, Donald Trump's and Hilary Clinton's post reaction, and Facebook events. We have learned a lot through out the project. In computer science aspect, we have the opporunity to shapern our skills in using API, getting request from website, using pandas dataframe in python, and practicing Python algorithms in general. Furthermore, we also strengthen our ability in analyzing practical data through Tableau and apply it into the real world problem. \n",

    "Outside of computer science aspect, we also discover what is a Facebook Graph API, how it gets information from Facebook users. We are also surpised and worried of how privacy can easily be invaded, and how sensitive information can easily be accessed. For someone who is a professional at using Facebook Graph API, it would take him/her 5 seconds to get all kind of information from Facebook. We hope that Facebook would fix and reconstruct the Graph API so that user do not have to worry about being invaded. However, we also believe that Facebook purposedly wants people to access our information. They probaby get paid from companies who want to advertise their products. They want our information such as our hobbies, our interests, so that they can specify the advertisement that we, Facebook user will receive."
