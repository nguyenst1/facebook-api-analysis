    "After getting all the access token as well as refreshing the token, we started requesting information for our analysis. Just to remind, our four goals are to find out which are the top twenty friends that like our post the most, demographic for places we have been tagged, reactions for every Trump's post, and lastly, the events on Facebook. My partner and I divide the  tasks in half and each of us worked on each half in order to save times. I started working on getting top friends that like our post the most and the places that we have beend tagged and my partner worked on the other half. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting getting the information, we played around with the Graph API Explorer to see what kind of information we can get from Facebook. Then, we started with the first question by using python to get the list of photo and see what kind of format it looked like. We used GET method to get the list of photo by parsing the url \"https://graph.facebook.com/me?fields=photos.limit(200)\". We would then decode the result and convert it into json. As soon as it was in json, we created a list that contain or the photo ids so that we could get number of reactions out of them. This was due to the fact that by parsing only the post id, we can get any type of information such as likes, reactions, and even comments over the Facebook Graph API. \n",
    "\n",
    "After creating a list, we then started to parse in each item to the list(which are the photo ids) into a GET request to obtain the reaction types. We then struggled with counting the total number of likes for each friend for every photo. Therefore, we had to stop for a moment and design an algorithm that could count total number of likes from each friend. Eventually, we figured that out and created a dictionary in which for every friend, it shows the total number of likes that they give for evey of our photo. Lastly, we wrapped up the first question by generate a dictionary that contains top friends who like our post the most. Furthermore, we also imported the dictionary into dataframe then into csv to prepared for the third notebook."

    "### Question: Get the top twenty frequency of friends who like our post \n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, it is our code for the first question, which is the top friends who like our post the most. First, we created a function to convert the response into json format since we would be making a lot of requests and create dictionary from them. This was quite easy and did not take a lot of our time. Next, we wrote a function to get the total number of reactions. We did this by parsing the ids of the object(which are the posts) into a GET request so that it can get the information from all objects. Then, we wrote another function called most_frequent to get the number of likes from each friend. This function took most of our time since we had to design an algorithm to sum up the total of likes from every friend. When this function worked, the rest was easier since we only had to put them in a dictionary and get the top 20 frequency. Lastly, we imported the dataframe of top 20 frequency into dataframe and to csv. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this question overall, another problem that we also struggled with was getting the top 20 frequency. First, after getting the total likes from everyone, we had to append the likes into a list. Then , we sorted the list from the most likes to the least likes and got the top 20. Then, we checked if the names and likes in the total likes dictionary were also in the top 20 list. If they were, we would put them into a new dictionary, whose keys were names and values were number of likes. Beside the frequency and the total likes algorithm that we designed, the other functions were quite straightforward. The function takes a facebook object id which could be a user or page, the numner of posts or photos we want to check for and the type of the post we want to check for. Hence, we offer a good amount of flexibility."

We want to create a demographic plot that show where we have been based on the latitudes and longitudes. Since we already know how to perform a GET request from the previous questions, this question did not take us a lot of times. We did this question by writing a function called tagged_data.\n",

Once the request was successful, we converted the response into json format and perform an iteration. We used list apprehension to create a list that include the data for places that we have been tagged. Then, we created a dictionary such that for each location data in the list, we would put the latitudes, longitudes and location names as the keys for the dictionary, and their values are the values in the dictionary. We later on appended each tagged location dictionary to a list."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "This notebook is the major part for this project, where we try to succeed the goals that we have set out. The four goals are getting the top 20 frequency of friends who like our post, Donald Trump's posts reactions, events on Facebook, and the places that we have been tagged in. Throughout this API Project, the second notebook is the most time-consuming notebook, and also the most complicated, in which we have to figure out so many things. First, we have to play around with the Graph API Explorer to learn the syntax for our GET request. Then, we have to design many algorithms so that it would retun what we want to analyze. For example, the algorithm for Trump's post reactions, all the algorithms for the total likes for every friend on Facebook. Lastly, we have to manipulate the data that we get to make it turn into dataframe for our third notebook. By and large, this notebook is the most complicated, but it is also the most fun notebook. I learn a lot from this notebook, not just about computer science or the API itself, but also about how to work with a partner and how to self-explore. Throughout this notebook, I have sharpened many skills for my future career."
